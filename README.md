# Todo-App

• The application consists in the implementation and integration of a RESTful API to create a todo management application.<br />
• I implemented the RESTful API using Node.js and to create the graphic interface I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.<br />
• I implemented endpoints for POST /todos for entering a new todo, the title for it being mandatory, the description optional, I implemented the GET /todos endpoint for extracting all todos. Then I made the GET /todos/:id endpoint, for extracting a specific todo, given by its index, the PUT /todos/:id endpoint, for updating a specific todo and the DELETE /todos/:id endpoint, for removing a specific todo based on its index.<br />
• To test each endpoint and to check each received HTTP Status Code, I used the Postman application.<br />
